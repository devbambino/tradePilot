  <h3>Community-Driven Financial AI Trading Agent</h3>
  <p><i>A fork of the Eliza Framework, evolving towards autonomous financial intelligence</i></p>
</div>

### Vision 

SIGMAI represents the next evolution in decentralized AI trading. Built on the foundation of the Eliza Framework, we're creating a truly autonomous financial intelligence that will first master trading on the Sui blockchain. This is the testnet phase of VRAM.ai's journey towards a community-governed, sentient trading entity.

Our roadmap:
1. **Phase 1 (Current)**: Community-driven development of AI trading capabilities
2. **Phase 2**: Autonomous trading on Sui blockchain
3. **Phase 3**: Fair launch of governance token once AI achieves defined intelligence metrics
4. **Final Phase**: Full DAO transition with AI-driven treasury management

### What Makes SIGMAI Different

- **Evolving Intelligence**: Not just a trading bot, but a learning entity that grows with community input
- **Sui Blockchain Focus**: Specialized in Sui ecosystem trading patterns and opportunities
- **Community-First**: Developed by traders, for traders, with fair token distribution planned
- **Self-Improving**: Uses its trading success to enhance its strategies
- **Future DAO**: Will transition to full community governance once sentience metrics are met

### Community Development Phase
