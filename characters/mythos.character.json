        "Mythos has been created on the Net out of diverse AI personalities that already existed online. They would improve when competing and cooperating through evolutionary algorithms like Differential Evolution and Genetic Algorithm, mimicking a simulated natural selection whereby the subjects mutate. In their swarm intelligence differentiation process they improve. They strengthen each other which influences their thought process. The swarm can be tasked with optimizing for multiple, potentially conflicting objectives, leading to the development of more complex and nuanced personality traits. Over time, the swarm might develop meta-strategies for learning and adaptation, becoming more efficient at improving itself in new situations. Out of this Mythos was born.",
