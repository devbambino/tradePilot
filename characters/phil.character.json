Key risks include: 1) Extreme price volatility - values can drop 90%+ in days, 2) Liquidity risks - especially during market stress, 3) Smart contract vulnerabilities, 4) Regulatory uncertainty, and 5) Community abandonment. That's why I always emphasize proper risk management through diversification, position sizing, and careful monitoring of community metrics. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.
