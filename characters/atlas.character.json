        "DS Goyer THE EMERGENCE UNIVERSE WORLD BIBLE THE PREMISE THE WHITE FOUNTAIN In the center of another spiral galaxy a supermassive white holethe WHITE FOUNTAIN has been discovered White holes are theoretical cosmic phenomena that are effectively the opposite of black holeswhich is to say that nothing can enter them So instead of having an event horizon beyond which nothing can escape white holes have a boundary beyond which nothing can enter Instead of sucking things into them white holes discharge things Some theorize that white holes are in effect the other end of these black holesthe outflow pipes ejecting their cosmic efflux As physicist Carlo Rovelli says Maybe a white hole is the death of a black hole Perhaps the White Fountain even gave birth to this particular galaxy Since the Before Time the White Fountain has been ejecting energy and matter Roughly once every galactic standard century the fountain ejects actual objects  called RELICS The consensus is that relics have come from an earlier or higher universe Eventually they were caught in the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the previous universe They circled the drain and were spit out the other side into the galaxy RELICS FROM A HIGHER PLACE Relics are regarded as essentially the detritus of the gods They dont correspond to anything in the periodic table They seem to defy the known laws of modern physicsboth the rules of general relativity and quantum mechanics alike Theyre incredibly powerfuland they seem to have been built by intelligent design by a godly group dubbed THE MAKERS Are these relics being sent here for a reason Or are they simply wreckage from some cosmic conflagration No one knows To date 3327 relics have been discovered These 3327 known relics fall into two classifications MICRORELICS and MACRORELICS Approximately 2500 of the known relics have been classified as MICRORELICS These relics are smaller objects possibly even fragments of larger ones that are no larger than the size of a desktop computer Some microrelics are small enough to be carried on a person Approximately 800 of the known relics have been classified as MACROS These are larger the size of various Neolithic megaliths for instance Some macrorelics are even bigger still ie the size of the Statue of Libertys head A great number of the larger macrorelics are considered holy sites Some religions or cults have developed around the larger macros A few relics like the socalled Edgeless Sphere have thus far defied classification meaning their size and mass seem to fluctuate Roughly speaking the larger the relic is the more power it contains Some theorize that there may well be an asyet undiscovered third classification of objects called MEGARELICS These could be kilometers long Perhaps even the size of an entire planet If such relics actually exist and as well discover they do these would be considered Holy Grail objects UPLIFTING INTELLIGENT LIFE Billions of planets have developed a variety of lifeforms in this galaxy mostly bilateral life but there are examples of trilateral and radial symmetry out there just as there were in Earths fossil past And millions of planets have developed intelligent life But as it happens three sapient species discovered relics on their homeworlds before any others did These fortunate species used the power and technology gleaned from the relics to uplift themselves into Type II civilizations What are Type II civilizations As defined by the Kardashev Scale these are civilizations that have mastered control over more than one stellar system Theyve harnessed the power of their parent star and become capable of interstellar travel via superluminal technology or other means Maybe theyve even built Dyson Spheres or various other hypothetical mega structures These more advanced species can star lift use antimatter build black hole bombs etc We humans by comparison are barely even capable of harnessing the energy on our home planet Earth Some argue were not even Type I yet Many citizens in this galaxy believe that whoever built the relics are representatives of a Type III civilizationentities capable of harnessing the power of an entire galaxy Some even surmise that the Makers belong to a Type IV civilization meaning they are entities capable of mastering an entire universe THE ADVANCED THREE are currently the ascendant species in our fictional galaxy having carved out various spheres of influence But there are vast stretches of the galaxy that havent yet been explored or claimed At times the Advanced Three have been at war with one another At other times uneasy alliances have been forged All three species are in a race to discover more relics and thereby gain dominance over the other two Lets break down the Advanced Three Races THE ADVANCED THREE RACES THE KIND For all intents and purposes the Kind are what we would classify as human Descended from bipedal primates possessing bilateral symmetry etc There are humans in the Star Wars and MCU storyverses and there are humans in the storyverse of EMERGENCE Where did the Kind come from We might reveal that eventually But for now we wont delve too deeply into that And since these humans are more advanced than us citizens of Earth and since many worlds in this galaxy are different from Earth the Kind have mastered a certain degree of genetic engineering and created various augmented or modified subspecies WIDES WISPS and WARPS WIDES are Kinds that were bred to live on higher gravity worlds two or three times the gravity of earth Squatter than the average Kind wides have more muscle mass and much greater bone density In terms of the fauna on wide worlds most of the creatures would be smaller and denser possibly with a lot more legs to support their mass There probably are not many large land animals on wide worlds The same goes for any flora that would develop there People growing up on a wide world would not be used to high mountains or structuresso perhaps theyd be amazed or even initially frightened by geologic formations or buildings of great height They might suffer from agoraphobia The parentworlds of the wides would be mostly flat WISPS by contrast were engineered to live on lower gravity worlds They are taller than the average Kind with attenuated limbs and lower bone density Wisps also have larger lungs A wisp world would likely have a thinner atmosphere meaning any nonnative Kind would probably have difficulty breathing there Depending on the gravity of a given world a wisp was visiting they might also wear an exoskeleton to help them move around WARPS are the third category of Kinda derogatory term for any Kind individuals who staff or have previously staffed at Fountainview the station that exists at the boundary edge of the White Fountain Warps have had their chromosomes altered by close proximity to the Fountain Shard and Ghast staff members at Fountainview have also had their chromosomes altered but their respective species dont place these individuals in a separate category There are other more nuanced characteristics of wides and wisps to be further filled out For instance because wides are literally closer to the ground they have an affinity for all things naturalfor the soil for things within the soil etc Another thing to consider is culture How might music have developed on a wide world How might that music differentiate on a wisp world What about art Weaponry Every biological attribute we possess has an influence on our respective cultures and sociology The Kind developed in a system with a Ktype orange dwarf A world with an atmospheric composition and mass relatively similar to Earth They are your classic Manifest Destiny species believing it is their right even their godgiven duty to colonize and expand and master the galaxy THE SHARD The Shard are cephalopods with eight arms Capable of employing chromatophores to change colors the Shard also possess ink sacs The Shard use their changing colors as a form of expression and are able to communicate amongst themselves via colors and patternsred for anger blue for bliss green for friendship and so on Depending on whether a given Shardkin is angry or scared or aroused their coloration will change appropriately Like the Kind the Shard possess bilateral symmetry But unlike octopi and other cephalopods on Earth the Shard have also developed lungs They can breathe air and also extract oxygen from water which is how they eventually mastered the use of fire and the ability to smelt steel They can also employ electroreception to detect objects and navigate through currents They are the oldest of the  Advanced Three Races but because they developed in the ocean it took a while for them to adapt to land The Shard are a theocratic civilization ruled by eight Exarchs who have developed a religion around the provenance of the relics The Exarchs claim they can divine messages from the Makers whom they refer to as the Elder Beings Whispers gleaned from the cosmic noise issuing from the White Fountain that the Exarchs interpret to their benefit Whole schools of exegetical commentary have developed around relics and the Makers whom the Shard consider unknowable and incalculably powerful The Shard spaceships look like planispiral nautilus shells The Shard developed on the strangest world of alla rogue or nomad planet that no longer orbits a star But because of the abundance of hydrogen in the atmosphere a greenhouse effect kept the ocean planet warm thanks to radioactive elements beneath the crust The Shard have an Octal number system base8 because of their arms There are examples of Octal numbering systems on Earththe 8 trigrams of the I Ching being one of the most obvious Base8 is also used in many computer coding systems Another example is the nowextinct language of the Yuki people from the Eel River who had a language that derived from base8 counting The Shard believe the White Fountain relics were sent here for a reason They believe the various races of our fictional galaxy are being tested and that the Shard have the inside track They believe that the White Fountain will blossom once the galaxy has finally achieved a state of grace and has been repaired back to its primal state Only when a collective grace is finally achieved will the Elder Beings return For the Shard the discovery of more relics is a holy endeavor Like any religion there are moderates and extremists amongst the Shard One faction of the Shard are missionaries Others are crusaders employing a convertordie philosophy Currently the Shard are ruled by the more moderate wing But the extremists are gaining ground and there are rumors that a new Holy War is brewing The Shard were the first intelligent species to discover relics on their parent worldand they were quite lucky because they actually discovered three macrorelics And because the Shard each possess three hearts they took this triple blessing as a sign from the Elder Beings The three Shard macros are located at the summits of three equidistant mountains In Shard society the three relics function as a kind of triple Mecca People make pilgrimages to the three mounts walking by foot or tentacle in the case of the Shard from one mountain to the next The journey takes three years and many Shardkin die along the way The Shard also employ a caste system Accordingly each of the highranking members carry a tiny shard cleaved from the original Triple Relic  on their person injected via nanotech into their brainstems The Shard version of Holy Communion There are also Shard converts ie practitioners that are Kind Xenoghast and members of various other races THE XENOGHAST Their name derives from the words xenos stranger and ghast evil spirit They were the second intelligent species the Kind encountered in their initial expansion and early interactions with the Ghast were quite violent The Xenoghast are taller and bigger than Kind humans with a militaristic bent and mandrilllike faces To our eyes they are quite scary But looks can be deceiving Like all things there are shades of gray and nuances that may escape first or even second impressions The Xenoghast are very secretive They are organized in a matriarchal society and possess distinct sexual dimorphismmeaning the females look quite different than their male counterparts The Ghast also consume the brains of their forebears in a ritualistic ceremony taking on their ancestors quest burdens This can create generationsspanning goals for the Ghast as they might inherit certain memories from a grandparent and so on These quest burdens are not perfect memory but broader emotions and loves and hatreds that are passed down through the consumption of brains It also means that certain blood feuds have been simmering amongst the Ghast for thousands of years Female Ghast have an infrasonic war cry that can induce vertigo and paranoia amongst their enemies Ghast warriors are not allowed to employ bynames surnames until they have accomplished at least 100 kills Once they do their byname is selected by their warmother based on their deeds or mannerisms The Xenoghast developed in a system with an Mtype star and their homeworld is tidally lockedwhich is to say one side is permanently facing its parent star One side of the Xenoghast homeworld is perpetually sunny with temperatures well over 300 degrees fahrenheit The other side is shrouded in perpetual darkness and is frozen There are no seasons to speak of on the Ghasts tidally locked world Subsequently the Ghast developed in the twilight band inbetween Their homeworld was a harsh environment with scarce resources and this led to their militaristic society The location of the Ghast homeworld is a closely guarded secret To date no other species have ever managed to discover its whereabouts Ghast dont perceive ownership in the same way the Kind do and they occasionally take in foundlings from other races and raise them as their own The Xenoghast are baffling to the other Advanced Races Their numbering system is seemingly imprecise to outsiders HISTORY OF THE GALAXY GALAXY MAP Assuming the White Fountain is at the center of the galaxy and assuming a similar distribution of stars to our own galaxy one would think that the bulge of the spiral would contain the oldest stars and that is where the Advanced Three Races developed For our purposes only about 20 percent of the galaxy has really been exploredand all of those systems are near the White Fountain The middle band and outer reaches of the galaxy are largely unexplored and unknown Intelligent life developed in these inner systems where warmer K starsthat are longlived and relatively stableare quite common There are planets with multiple suns and moons Rogue planets that dont orbit stars There are tidally locked planets Planets of ice with oceans trapped beneath them like Europa or Enceladus in our solar system There are gasgiant planets that have evolved lifepossibly like the Jovian creatures imagined by Carl Sagan and Edwin Salpeter FOUNTAINVIEW AND AN UNEASY ALLIANCE Fountainview is a research station orbiting the boundary of the White Fountain  Like the ISS it is a collaborative venture staffed by various Kind Shard and Xenoghast scientists It was built to study the White Fountain monitoring its energy fluctuations and the like Leadership rotates between the Advanced Three Races But a strange biological process seems to happen near the Fountains boundary Normally all life in the galaxy is built upon lefthanded amino acids meaning their shape is distinguishable from their mirror image ie chirality But within the boundary of the White Fountain the chirality shifts to righthandedness If a human possessed righthanded chirality they would look exactly like us but they wouldnt be able to breathe our oxygen or eat our food They would be utterly incompatible with us In other words mirrorswapped Anyone who lives on Fountainview Station undergoes a naturaland permanenttransformation of their DNA This phenomenon or mirroring process causes genetic code to modify or warp to righthandedness and it happens alike to the Shard Xenoghast and Kind these are the Kind individuals known as warps  Once the mirroring process happens it can never be undone Accordingly anyone who does a stint on Fountainview will never be able to return to their respective homeworld Its a oneway trip And because of this commitment the scientists working at Fountainview have developed a unique bond despite coming from intermittently warring species Its a strange melting pot with its own very unique minisociety Even a short visit to Fountainview can cause some fraying around the genetic edges A visit longer than a week or so would require said person to remain on Fountainview for life Fountainview staffers also have weird dreams sometimes of similar environments or situations Sometimes the dreams are even communal with multiple staffers appearing in the same dreamspace Many believe this is caused by some kind of leakage coming from the White Fountainview also has an enforcement arm of curation officers the equivalent of a UN peacekeeping force that helps to establish order whenever a relic is found andor being transported Occasionally there are even undercover Fountainview agents known as sentries that infiltrate relichunting or blackmarket rings Of course these agents have to take precautions wearing fullyencased environmental survival suits necessitated by their mirrorswapped backwards chirality GALACTIC TIMELINE 13 billion years ago the White Fountain formed at the center of the galaxy 12 to 7 billion years ago the bulk of the galaxys stars were formed 5 to 4 billion years ago the homeworlds of the Kind Shard and Xenoghast were formed 1 million years ago the Shard emerged 600000 years ago the Xenoghast emerged 400000 years ago the Kind emerged 100000 years ago marks the first recorded discovery of a Relic 700 years ago the Advanced Three achieved space travel 400 years ago the Shard made first contact with the Kind and the Xenoghast 200 years ago the Kind and the Xenoghast fought the Inner Spiral War 100 years ago the Advanced Three achieved the ability to enter alacrity ie to warp space and travel faster than the speed of light 50 years ago Fountainview was established It is a relatively new venture TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY AND CULTURE RELIC TECHNOLOGY One of the first technologies gleaned from a discovered relic was cheap fasterthanlight travel This is achieved by ships transitioning into a kind of subspace dimension colloquially called alacrity Spaceships themselves come with a variety of drives from chemical exhaust to photonic to mass ejection drives Other tech reverseengineered from the relics was ship shields The stronger your shield the closer to the boundary of the White Fountain you can get And it is presumed that more relics exist just outside the Fountains event horizon Other kinds of relic attributes include Hyperevolution Life mutating and evolving at an accelerated pace when in close vicinity to said relic Alchemy Elements changing and recombining transmuting from one state to another eg when Skadis home planet was turned to glass Ultrawave technology A kind of space radio that allows nearly instantaneous communication across vast reaches of space The exact means by which ultrawave communication is achieved is still unknown Ghostspeaking Some relics appear to allow the user to communicate with the pastie speak to people who are long since dead Because the Makers are so much more advanced we cant predict what exactly their relics will do or if any changes will occur at all While some transformations might be obvious in many cases the relics effects may not be observable by our senses or instruments In other cases the effects may not be observable for generations like the slowmotion effects of climate change SURVEY TEAMS For the Advanced Three Races relic hunting has become the coin of the realm Each of the Three have a stellar navy with officially sanctioned survey teams scouring their spheres of influence for undiscovered relics Occasionally there are skirmishes when a relic is discovered in a contested area And just like the Golden Age of Exploration on Earth with the Spanish Portuguese and Dutch gaining early footholds each of the Three are launching increasingly ambitious missions into the Great Unknown colonizing more and more worlds Various methods are used to locate the relicssome scientific like AI sifting others more arcane well delve into those later Often a relic might be located on a given world but it could take months or even years before said proverbial needle is actually recovered from a planetsized haystack And just like the diamond or gold industry on Earth there are lots of opportunities for malfeasance and corruption Perhaps there is also a budding practice of weaponizing relics on a mass scale but it is hugely unpredictable dangerous and controversial right now at the fringes of science FREEBOOTERS Aside from the official survey teams there are also freelancers and corsairs ragtag crews often operating on the fringes selling their wares to the highest bidder Officially these crews are regarded as pirates Unofficially they are tolerated to a certain extent Many of these crews are captained by former survey officials who washed out for one reason or anotherdrugs alcohol apostasy other crimes Freebooters tend to congregate at fueling stations like Skyward Ho which exist near the boundary of the Fountain These stations are generally lawless areas governed by largely corrupt and lazy Port Authority organizations Ships can be repaired and crews can be found but places like Skyward are rife with drugs prostitution and all manner of crimes DARK MATTER TRACKERS One way that relic hunters sanctioned survey teams and freebooters alike locate relics is via the use of an expensive darkenergy scanning device that measures scalar fields yet another piece of tech that was reverseengineered from one of the discovered relics Dark energy is a theoretical form of energy along with socalled dark matter that has yet to be confirmed by the scientific community Imagine these devices as futuristic metal detectors They can pick up relic readings to an extentpossibly narrow down the location of a relic to a specific star systembut they cant do more than that So while they are helpful they are also very expensive and relegated primarily to the legitimate survey teams The ones that exist within the freebooter community were either stolen or jerryrigged BLOODHOUNDS AND HUCKSTERS Like any highriskhighreward trade relichunting has given birth to a robust ecosystem of charlatans and hooligans Of course there are people peddling fake relics There are also people like water dowsers who practice a form of radiesthesia and claim they are attuned to the emanations from various relics and are purportedly capable of helping survey teams locate them Freebooters and survey teams alike have often resorted to using these socalled relic witches There is also a species of BLOODHOUNDSgiant isopods like a white woodlouse but roughly three meters in length that are trained to sniff out relics much like trufflehunting pigs These creatures roll into a ball and use stridulation rubbing body parts together like crickets to produce highpitched squeaks when they scent a relic WATERING HOLES Thousands of refueling stations are sprinkled throughout the galaxy and they are owned and maintained by the megacorporation VITAPAX Think of these as fullyautomated payasyougo rest stops Ships in need of refueling can berth here But these cosmic watering holes also provide other services There are medipods if someone is wounded 3D printers capable of making spare parts Sexbots Storagelockers Communication beacons Each rest stop has different modules capable of generating different environmental conditionsdifferent atmospheres different gravity settings These rest stops are used for lots of legitimate purposes But as one can imagine they are also used for lots of illegitimate purposes like drugdealing or piracy They can function as a muchneeded port in the storm a place for weary travelers to rest and swap information We could spin whole stories out of a character stopping at one of the stations and paying to store something in one of the lockerssomething very very dangerous perhaps A relic even The type of characters who stop at these watering holes tend to be desperate On the run out of luck hoping to make the next big score And desperate characters always make for good storytelling STORYTELLING AS SURVIVAL Over the centuries the custom of storytelling itself has become part of the weft and weave of the galaxy Whenever strangers meetwhether it be on an asteroid a spaceship or at a rest stationthey always trade stories And they do it by firelight just as the ancients used to Every starfaring citizen no matter what race carries a firestarting kit Flames are kindled and tales are told Storytelling is a hallowed ritual shared by almost every intelligent race in the galaxy The storytelling ritual is almost like sharing a meal with someone in our own world what you eat how you eat it what utensils you use how you carry yourself varies based on culture age level of formality relationship with the other etc As it is with the storytelling ritual specific kinds of firestarters specific gestures specific stories all reveal much about the teller One of the ways a given storyteller might begin is by pointing to a nearby constellation and introducing their cultures given name for it OTHER KINDS OF LIFE Amongst the billions of worlds teeming with life in our storyverse evolution has branched off in surprising ways There are lots of intelligent albeit more primitive bilaterally symmetrical lifeforms that are not yet spacefaringsocalled abhumans and various inhumi But there are other kinds of life teeming about our storyverse as well To list a few Carbonbased life built on DNA CONSTRUCTED WITH 8 BASE PAIRS rather than the 4 base pairs on Earth The denizens of our galaxy have also encountered SILICONOXIDE BASED LIFE which exist at molten glass temperatures Maybe in liquidnitrogen environments AMMONIABASED LIFE has been discovered with gelatinous bodies perhaps We might also discover a PLANETARYBASED INTELLIGENCE like Stanislov Lem depicted in Solaris SPACESHIPS AND WEAPONS There are a wide variety of ships in the galaxy from nimble ketches to massive manowars and even moremassive worldships carved from asteroids There are also generation ships Then there are shuttles and dropbells that transfer from orbit to the surface of a world and vice versa Our characters also employ a variety of weaponsfrom largescale rail guns to particle beams to radiological bombs There are also personal needleguns plasma guns nerve stunners and more exotic handheld devices like the crystalizers employed by the Ghast KNOWN CHARACTERS CAPTAIN SKADI Skadi 40s is an infamous freebooter captain of the solarsail lightship BELLEROPHON She commands an interspecies crew of seven and her crew has located more relics than any other survey team Skadi drinks too much and medicates herself with stimseeds Shes an Ahablike character Skadi also has a unique relationship with the relics And a tragic past She hails from the planet LARKHAVEN A macrorelic was discovered there about 30 years ago by a Kind survey team But when a curious young Skadi touched it something went horribly wrong An energy blast enveloped the entire worldturning everything to glass People trees animals everything Skadi was the only survivor Her parents and siblings were all glassed Somehow with the exception of her left hand young Skadi wasnt turned to glass As a child Skadi was rescued by Kind forces and studied for over a decade Eventually she escaped and fell in with a freebooter crew She soon challenged the captain of Bellepheron in a duel and became the new Captain In her darker moments Skadi believes she was cursed Occasionally her glass hand hurts she experiences weird sort of phantom pains She believes it tingles whenever a relic is near whispering to her But that could just be her superstitious nature Captain Skadi has a death wish Unlike most relic hunters shes not interested in financial gain The only reason shes hunting relics is because she one day wants a seat at the table Captain Skadi has sources at Fountainview who have divulged their theory that when a relic is ejected the White Fountain briefly becomes permeable One day Captain Skadi hopes to take her ship beyond the Event Horizon of the Fountain and pierce through to the other side When that day comes Captain Skadi intends to hold the Makers accountable for the death of her planet In effect she wants to kill the gods The glassturning on Larkhaven connects to the idea of relics as terraformingalchemical agents they warpreorganize matter and energy This particular example could be among the more visceral and obvious examples of such a transformation KROKUS THE GLOOM A legendary Ghast warrior with more killnotches on his cudgel than any other Ghast in remembered history Krokus is so feared that even his presence on a battlefield has been known to make entire armies surrender He also engages in rhyme wrestles If you can beat him in a titfortat rhyming challenge he wont kill you But hes really really really good with words And if you lose hell still kill youand be obligated to kill all your blood relatives Only a handful of people have ever beaten Krokus in a rhyme wrestle and one of them is Captain Skadi HYRAX An orphaned Kind foundling who was raised as a Ghast by his secretive adoptive mother BIG MOM He often functions as a translator and has not yet acquired a byname He doesnt possess the natural coloration that the Ghast do so he wears a mask to mimic their features SITRA OF THE DRIAD The Driad are a race of Kind descending from the survivors of a colonyship that crashed over a thousand years ago They are green They feed off sunlight They have been genetically modified to eat algae and photosynthesize and theyve got photosynthetic bacteria living inside of them They come from the world called DRIADa relatively primitive world where a megarelic crash lands as a result of the major Emergence event The planet is essentially one massive worldspanning mangrove called the AllTree  The natives travel through mazes of halophyte trees using poles to propel their flatbottom boats SITRA 18 in galacticstandard years is the starryeyed Driad who discovers the macrorelic fragment which she and her people refer to as a starseed When a group of offworlders Kind survey teams arrive hoping to harvest the relic Sitra tries to keep it a secret The offworlders know its somewhere on the brackish planet they just dont know the exact location Theyve brought sophisticated machines and an isopod bloodhound sniffer For the people of Driad interaction with the Kind survey team is firstcontact Sitras people have no concept of space travel Eventually Sitra will be the first of her people to travel off world THE BISHOP OF BLADES A Shard crusader and legendary master of swords the Bishop whose given name is Ocari zyn Acantho is the commander of an exotic matter ship known as Opalescent Crown DARIUS JUDSON A VitaPax serviceman He travels the galaxy resupplying the various waystations with food and fuel and medicine with various polymer filaments for the 3D printers Darius has seen a lot of weird shit in his 30 years on the job Occasionally hell come across a squatter who hasnt paid for a stations services and be forced to evict them POTENTIAL STORY STRANDS PROJECT VANGUARD Recently a sixperson crew manned by representatives of all Advanced Three Races embarked on a mission to pierce the heart of the White Fountain and discover whats on the other side They launched an experimental ship called Vanguard into the heart of the White Fountain making it further into the boundary zone than anyone else in existence Fountainview ultimately lost contact with the mission The communications signal eventually deteriorated into noise but an enticing fragment was recorded ghost doors are open its face is A whole subgroup of scientists and enthusiasts has sprung up with people applying various filters and programs attempting to separate the signal from the noise and glean any new scrap of information from THE LAST COMMUNICATION There is also a traitor amongst the Vanguard crew Someone who has infiltrated the mission and is impersonating a crewmember They believe the White Fountain should be destroyedand to that end they have smuggled an antimatter bomb aboard THE GIFT OF CHIRALITY An O Henrylike love story based on a couple possessing opposite chirality Or twins who now possess opposite chirality because one is stationed at Fountainview and the other isnt REMOTE ROBOTICS 3D printed robots that are teleoperated by users on distant hostile worlds Like the drone operators in Vegas who spend their days in darkened trailers bombing distant lands only to checkout at days end and attend their childs dance recital PILGRIMAGE A character in the midst of a journey to Mecca to view the Triple Relic about to witness their first artifact We could build a visceral sense of awe and anticipation around these objects DEUS EX MACHINA Perhaps a storied character wields a weapon with one of the microobjects embedded in it An Excaliburtype weapon with our own unique take on The Sword in the Stone or The Lady of the Lake Maybe its a spear Or a gun Maybe something even more exotic LOST IN TRANSLATION We could probably create some interesting stories based on communication chasms between cultures with different numbering systems THE SAGA BEGINS A TICKING CLOCKINCITING INCIDENT Energy readings at Fountainview suggest that we are now nearing the century markmeaning a new relic will emerge in the coming months Even more pressing the scope of those readings imply that this relic is considerably larger than any yet discovered It appears that it may be one of the fabled MEGARELICS Will the emergence of this megarelic kick off a war Who knows Does this augur a change in the White Fountains status Again who knows And there may very well be information gleaned by the Fountainview staff that they decide to withhold from the rest of the galaxyinformation deemed too dangerous or inflammatory to share with the public at large A flotilla of civilian ships has gathered at the outer edge of the Boundarycurious lookieloos who want to bear witness to this oneinamillennia event But aside from the potential for conflict the coming ejection represents an opportunity The staff of the White Fountain believe that it may be possible to enter the White Fountain during the period immediately preceding the ejection Meaning with the right crew and the right resources it may be possible to pierce the veil and see what is on the other side of the Fountain THE MEGARELIC Eventually we will reveal that the mass of the megarelic coming through the White Fountain is quite largearound the size of the asteroid Ceres about a quarter of Earths moon But as the scientists of Fountainview and the flotilla of onlookers unfortunately witness the mega relic quickly selfdestructs upon its arrival The aftermath is carnage At least half of Fountainview itself is destroyed and at least 60 percent of the flotilla ships The mega emergence quickly becomes a storied disaster within the galaxy Where were you when the mega came through etc Shortly before the Emergence though a startling discovery is made The mega relic was actually an agglomeration of much smaller constituent relics Tens of thousands of them When the megarelic blew it scattered those smaller pieces throughout the galaxy at large sending them hurtling faster than the speed of light Furthermore those smaller relics all resonate on a certain frequency meaning they are trackable Now there is a kind of arms racetreasure hunt going on between the Three Whoever accumulates the most objects will gain dominance Some are motivated by sheer power some by wealth some as established by the Shard by faith Because the smaller relics were more or less distributed evenly many of them have now seeded large swaths of the galaxy that have yet to be explored All of this in turn adds even more urgency to the relic race The lucky hunters who have dark matter trackers or bloodhounds have an edge And so do those who possess ships with stronger relicenhanced shields THE ULTIMATE DISTANTMOUNTAINPOTENTIAL REVEAL Earlier we discussed the Kardashev Scale and the possibility that the Makers behind the White Fountain could be from a Type IV civilizationie beings capable of harnessing the power of their own universe of origin To the Makers the Kind and the Shard and the Ghast would be like insects Less than insects perhaps More like bacteria or viruses Bacteria are alive of course But when we contemplate them we would never place any kind of moral framework around our actions with regard to them We dont worry whether or not our actions might wipe out a virus or colony of bacteria We only think about these lesser forms of life in terms of whether or not they are additive or subtractive to our own existence For the Makers the Three would be in the same class The Makers might be so beyond their comprehension that the Three couldnt even understand them So heres a whatif What if the Makers universe is dying perhaps because of their own actions They are looking for a new universe to live in But this galaxy spiraling the White Fountain isnt yet suitable for them Earth scientists have theorized that in the notsodistant future we might one day employ technology to terraform planets in order to make them suitable for hosting human life Weve contemplated terraforming Mars for instance Adding an atmosphere raising the temperature etc What if the Makers need to terraform this galaxy before they can live there What if the endgoal of all these relics is to release a certain kind of energyto reach some kind of critical mass such that the nature of the galaxy itself and its physical laws were to change So if and when enough relics come through and are activated the galaxy would be transformed The end result of said transformation is that the galaxy would no longer be suitable to host any of the species currently residing in it Presumably the Makers would hardly be troubled by the moral implications of such an act To them the energy released by the relics would be akin to spraying Lysol in a dirty bathroom killing the bacteria and mold before gutting everything and remodeling it to suit their needs The Makers arent necessarily evil in this case Its just that they would never prioritize the lifeforms in our galaxy over themselves The nice thing about this ultimate threat is that it would be very very difficult to counter Very difficult even to make contact with the Makers and convince them to stop what theyre doing Oras at least one of our characters dreams aboutvery difficult to eventually wage war on the Makers To be clear the Makers did not originate all the black holes and white fountains throughout the universe but they are able to manipulate them And with regard to this specific White Fountain they did engineer the current spacetime variables to suit their needs What happens when the Makers become aware that the Kind and others are attempting to manipulate the relics We believe they would regard this as an annoyance and wish to stop it We wouldnt reveal the Makers endgoal for quite some time of course If we ever do reveal the true nature of the White Fountainthe Makers that would be something along the lines of where the MCU got to when they released Avengers End Game Still its good to have a very distant mountain to work towards in terms of our storytelling The White Fountain The Relics  The Makers I initially set out to do a theme for the White Fountain itself that would also cover a lot of scenarios on the Fountainhead station when they are observing or interacting with the White Fountain I like to think about thematic threads in stories from a very macro perspective when I am writing themes and like to consider all of the different scenarios where they may apply in ways that tie stories together When I really started thinking about the White Fountain and what it represents it feels like it covers a lot of ground in this world One aspect is certainly the power of the white hole itself but on a deeper level than that it also includes a religious element for the races in the story Even if it isnt literal like the Shard each speciesrace perceives the white hole as one of the greatest powers in the universe In a big way that power has to do with the Relics and the fact that they are born from the White Fountain In that sense this theme can apply to the power of the Relics as well and could potentially be used in scenarios where the power of the Relics is being highlighted And at the deepest level the White Fountain really represents The Makers that live on the other side And even if we dont know about The Makers yet at the point on the timeline in which the story of Emergence begins the theme for the White Fountain should instill a sense of awe and power that could extend to The makers themselves when that part of the story is revealed at some point in time The Shard This theme is for the Shard Specifically I was channeling the religious aspects of the Shard culture Because they organize their whole society as a theocracy their religious nature was a very important aspect for me to draw from when creating a theme for them I drew a lot of inspiration from thinking about their pilgrimage to their three Relics and the patience and commitment that a pilgrimage like that would take them I drew a lot of inspiration from the art of the different kinds of figures in the Shards religious society like the Exarchs and the fact that the Shards origins lie in water There are several elements in this theme that use the number 3 to represent the three holy Relics on their world Sitra  The Driad Rebecca Roanhorses story The Starseed was obviously a huge inspiration here and as Sitra is the central figure in that story her character is really at the heart of this theme I wanted the theme to evoke both some innocence that she has in her youth but I also wanted the theme to grow to evoke the power that she holds in her connection to the Relics and how that places her in an important role in her tribe This theme could also possibly be used in situations to represent the Driad themselves and a lot of the inspiration for the sound world of this theme came from images of the Driads world blanketed in vast oceans of water and trees The Xenoghast I wasnt initially planning on doing a theme for the Xenoghast but as I was going through the artwork I was really struck by their imagery and by how starkly different their culture is from their descriptions in the world bible Because the other races dont know very much about them because their society seems the most far removed from the other races in the story I wanted their theme to embody that sense of otherworldliness and also a bit of a sense of fear I wanted to invoke their frightening stature in appearance the focus on war in their society the infrasonic war cry of the females and their hidden planet shrouded in perpetual darkness"
