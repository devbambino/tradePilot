# Running several models 


## Multiple Characters acting as a Team:
You can run two characters that can interact.. This is a good example to learn, how the sytem works...
Lets go:
```
pnpm start:debug --characters=~./eliza/characters/bud.character.json,~./eliza/characters/terence.character.json
```
start both character the same time. To make them a team and use different Discord Instances, you need to modify their header in the character file:

Thats the one for Bud:
```
{
    "name": "Bud",
    "plugins": [],
    "clients": ["discord"],
    "modelProvider": "akash_chat_api",
    "settings": {
        "secrets": {
            "DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID": "138364583265387224",
            "DISCORD_API_TOKEN": "MTMzMDEzMzuihfiuewhfeqiuhfqiuewhfewqHh7E_9dK3zQp577QWKjS4i-wz78"
        },
        "voice": {
            "model": "en_US-male-heavy"
        }
    },
    "clientConfig": {
        "discord": {
            "isPartOfTeam": true,
            "teamAgentIds": ["1330134542060752936"],
            "teamLeaderId": "1330134542060752936",
            "teamMemberInterestKeywords": ["Terence", "partner", "team", "friend", "adventure"],
            "shouldRespondOnlyToMentions": false
        }
    },
```

thats the one for Terence:
```
{
    "name": "Terence",
    "clients": ["discord"],
    "modelProvider": "akash_chat_api",
    "settings": {
        "secrets": {
                "DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID": "133487326438726452936",
                "DISCORD_API_TOKEN": "MTMzMDEziuhfiufheiuqhiuqewhfiuewqhf6np9Rtf2yvREDgJ8"
            },
        "voice": {
            "model": "en_US-male-medium"
        }
    },
    "clientConfig": {
        "discord": {
            "isPartOfTeam": true,
            "teamAgentIds": ["1330133186734456924"],
            "teamLeaderId": "1330134542060752936",
            "teamMemberInterestKeywords": ["Bud", "buddy", "partner", "team", "friend", "trouble"],
            "shouldRespondOnlyToMentions": false
        }
    },
```
The "shouldRespondOnlyToMentions": false attribute make some more agile in chats! They will give their 5 cents on every occassion

There is always one Leader, but multiple Members. If you have a bigger team add their id's like this:
```
"teamAgentIds": ["1330133186734456924", "1330133186734456925", "1330133186734456926"]
```
you should see the ID in the Logs or you can retrieve them in the database too
