*** 1. Windows PC with PuTTY

- *PuTTY*: A terminal emulator that allows you to connect to the Linux server using SSH.

*** 2. Linux Server

**** Components:
- *sshd*: The OpenSSH daemon that handles SSH connections.
- *SSM (Session Manager)*: AWS Systems Manager's tool for managing and automating tasks on instances
   in an Amazon EC2 environment.
- *tmux*: A terminal multiplexer that allows you to create multiple virtual terminals within a
   single physical terminal session.
- *Emacs*: An extensible text editor.
- *Git*: A distributed version control system.

**** Workflow:
1. *SSH Connection via PuTTY*:
   - You connect to the Linux server using PuTTY.
   
2. *Forwarding SSH Port (pipe1)*:
   - SSM forwards the SSH port from the aws server (default 22) to a custom port (2222) on the Linux
     server.

3. *Using tmux and Emacs*:
   - You use ~tmux~ to create multiple virtual terminals.
   - Within these terminals, you run ~emacs~ as your editor.
   
4. *Git Pull via pipe1*:
   - You perform a ~git pull~ operation through the forwarded SSH port.

*** 3. AWS Server

**** Components:
- *SSM Agent*: A service that allows you to manage and automate tasks on instances in an Amazon EC2
   environment.
- *sshd*: The OpenSSH daemon.
- *Ubuntu User*: An account on the Ubuntu server.
- */opt/git/agent*: A directory where a Git agent script is located.

**** Workflow:
1. *SSM Agent*:
   - The SSM Agent runs as a service and allows you to manage and automate tasks on the instance.

2. *SSH Connection via Pipe1*:
   - The Linux server forwards the SSH port to a custom port (2222) on the AWS server.

3. *Git Agent Script*:
   - A script located at ~/opt/git/agent~ is used for Git operations.
   - This script might perform actions like pulling updates, pushing changes, or managing
     repositories.

*** Interactions Between Components

1. *Windows PC -> Linux Server*:
   - PuTTY connects to the Linux server using SSH.
   - SSM forwards the port 22 on the AWS server to port 2222 on the Linux server.

2. *Linux Server -> AWS Server*:
   - The Linux server performs an ~ssh~ connection to the AWS server through the forwarded port
     (pipe1).
   - The script at ~/opt/git/agent~ runs on the AWS server and can pull or push changes using Git.

This setup allows for a seamless interaction between the Windows client and the AWS server using
various tools and protocols.
